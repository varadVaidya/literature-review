# Dynamic Movement Primitives in Robotics
Biological systems, including human beings, have the innate ability to perform complex tasks in versatile and agile
manner. These biological systems are then able to combine basic units into more complex task, leading to the formulation os the motor primitives theory.  
In this respect, the **Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMP)** are an excellent mathematical formulation of these motor primitives as a stable Dyanamical Systems, and are used to generate commands for robots.  

## How to Biological Systems move?
The research in neurobiology motor control, led to the formulation of the *Motion Primitive Theory* This explains the exceution of the complex movements with sequencing of primitive actions, which can be directly implemented in robotic systems.  

DMPs are thus the first to attempt to answer the question. 
> How artificial systems, like (humanoid) robots, can execute complex movements in a versatile and creative manner?

Other properties of DMP are: 
* simple and elegant formulation
* guarantee convergence to a given target
* are sufficiently flexible to create complex behaviors
* are capable of reacting to external perturbations in real-time
* and can be learned from data using efficient algorithms.
